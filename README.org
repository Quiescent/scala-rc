* Introduction
=scala-rc= is a minor mode which adds a =completion-at-point= function
to help you complete symbols in a Scala REPL.

* Progress
So far it supports completion of members on objects.

* Still TODO
 - [X] support completion of class members;
 - [ ] support completion of symbols in the environment;
 - [ ] support completion of packages;

* Ideas
I'm open to ideas :)  This is a relatively new project and it could go
in many directions at this point.

* Contributing
When this package is ready I'd like to contribute it to ELPA.  Please
be aware that if I'm successful at getting it into ELPA then any
significant contributions will require that you sign papers with the
FSF.

* Known Problems
 - [ ] Trying to define a class can bomb out the heuristic to detect
   the end of input from the Scala process
